BUG#1 -- STATUS: reproducible, not yet fixed

From: keith.briggs@bt.com
To: gsl-discuss@sources.redhat.com
Subject: gsl_sf_hyperg_2F1 bug report
Date: Thu, 31 Jan 2002 12:30:04 -0000

gsl_sf_hyperg_2F1_e fails with arguments (1,13,14,0.999227196008978,&r).
It should return 53.4645... .

#include <gsl/gsl_sf.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
  gsl_sf_result r;
  gsl_sf_hyperg_2F1_e (1,13,14,0.999227196008978,&r);
  printf("r = %g %g\n", r.val, r.err);
}

NOTES: The program overflows the maximum number of iterations in
gsl_sf_hyperg_2F1, due to the presence of a nearby singularity at
(c=a+b,x=1) so the sum is slowly convergent.

The exact result is 53.46451441879150950530608621 as calculated by
gp-pari using sumpos(k=0,gamma(a+k)*gamma(b+k)*gamma(c)*gamma(1)/
(gamma(c+k)*gamma(1+k)*gamma(a)*gamma(b))*x^k)

The code needs to be extended to handle the case c=a+b. This is the
main problem. The case c=a+b is special and needs to be computed
differently.  There is a special formula given for it in Abramowitz &
Stegun 15.3.10

BUG#2 -- STATUS: reproducible, not yet fixed

In QAWO the expressions center-half_length and center+half_length should
be replaced by a and b to avoid cancellation errors which occur for 
ranges like [1e-30, 1]

One of the continued fraction computations is breaking down

BUG#4 -- STATUS: reproducible, not yet fixed

From: David Necas (Yeti) <yeti@physics.muni.cz>
To: Brian Gough <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>
Subject: Re: gsl_linalg_solve_symm_cyc_tridiag problem
Date: Sun, 14 Apr 2002 18:02:21 +0200

The function gsl_linalg_solve_symm_cyc_tridiag() crashes when run with
N = 1 (and doesn't make sense even with N = 2) -- it should return
some error code instead (the same applies to its non-cyclic
counterpair).

Both cyclic and non-cyclic solvers return zero error code when feed
with singular matrices, or fail for another reason (so the results are
only bunches of NaN's). They should return some error code instead.
