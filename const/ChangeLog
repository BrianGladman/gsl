	* calc-units-update.el (math-additional-units): updated unit
 	values, in a backwards compatible way.  Made mue an absolute
 	value, and put Ryd in energy units.

	* calc-units-update.el (math-additional-units): Add this file to
	provide updated costants for Emacs calc.  (These values are in the
	current development versions of GNU Emacs and Xemacs already.)

Mon Apr  1 19:27:57 2002  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el (gsl-constants): Added newton, dyne, joule, erg and
 	power-of-ten prefixes, Mega, Giga, Tera, etc.

Tue Jan  8 21:48:56 2002  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el (gsl-constants): added bohr_radius and
 	vacuum_permittivity

Tue Sep 25 15:15:33 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el (fn): make all output double precision to avoid
 	possibility of unexpected integer division.
	(gsl-constants): fix definition of barn and btu
	(gsl-constants): added solar mass

Tue Jan 23 16:19:50 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el (gsl-constants): fixed definition of POINT (from pt to
 	point, was previously measuring 'pints')
